### Get to know you

-	Tell me your name?
-	Year in college you are in?
-	What do you know about networking?
-	More importantly what do you want to learn about computer networking? We have some room in the schedule. 
-	Did you do any internships this or past summers?
-	Favorite programming language? The reason I ask about the language is that we can adjust any programming assignments. 
-	Where are you from? 
-	Anything else you consider important.
