Course website
-----------------

Please check the course web page, <https://ycpcs.github.io/cs330-fall2023/>, regularly for important announcements.

Reading assignments
-----------------

Readings from your text book will be assigned throughout the semester. You will find the readings listed in the Course Schedule. <strong>You are encouraged to read the scheduled material before coming to class.</strong>

Homework, Labs and Assignments
-----------------

Homework assignments will be based on the lab activities performed during class and may include both written and programming components. High Level Design collaboration on homework assignments is encouraged, but each student must submit their own assignment solutions that demonstrate their understanding of the material.

<p>Most labs will incorporate Wireshark: <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">https://www.wireshark.org/</a>. Wireshark is installed in the lab.</p>

**You MUST make a legitimate attempt to complete every homework assignment.** I reserve the right to fail any student who does not make a good faith effort to complete all of the homework assignments.

### Late policy

Late assignments will be marked down 20% per day late. **No credit will be given for assignments that are more than three (3) days late.**

**Important**: As mentioned above in the **Grades** section, you must make a good faith effort to complete all of the homework assignments in order to receive a passing grade for the course.

Programming Assignments will be graded based on the following criteria:

> 4: **Superior.** The program extends the basic requirements significantly by implementing additional features covered in the text and other resources.
>
> 3-3.5: **Good.** The program goes beyond the basic requirements by embellishing the final output using techniques discussed in class.
>
> 2-2.5: **Average.** The program meets only the basic requirements of the assignment.
>
> 1: **Below Average.** The program produces mostly incorrect output or shows little attempt at a solution to the problem.
>
> 0: **Failure.** The program does not execute.

Posting and submission of assignments and labs
-----------------

Assignments and labs will be posted on the course web page,  [https://ycpcs.github.io/cs330-fall2023/](<https://ycpcs.github.io/cs330-fall2023/>).

Assignments and labs will be submitted using the server <a href="https://cs.ycp.edu/marmoset/">https://cs.ycp.edu/marmoset/</a>. You will receive an email containing the username and password you will use for this server.

Exams
-----------------

<strong>Exams will be open-book, closed-notes.</strong> They will last approximately 60 minutes and will be administered at the beginning of the class period.

<strong>Exams may include a programming component.</strong> The last half of the class may be used for instruction and/or laboratory work.
<strong>A total of four exams will be administered.</strong>

<strong>No make-up exams will be given without approval of the instructor prior to class unless proof of extreme emergency or illness is provided.</strong>

Academic Integrity
-----------------

York College’s mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to principles of academic honesty is expected of all students. Therefore, academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc., and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others and claim such work as their own.

The following policy pertains to homework and (individual) lab assignments:

> All graded (individual) programming assignments are to be completed individually. I encourage you to discuss high level concepts with other students, but any work you submit **must be yours alone**.
>
> Direct copying of code or other work from other students, web sites, or other sources **is absolutely forbidden under any circumstances**.
>
> Any sources (books, websites, articles, fellow students, etc.), except for the course textbook and lecture notes, that you consult in completing an assignment **must be properly acknowledged**. In general, I strongly discourage you from using any resource not explicitly listed in the course syllabus or on the course web page. When you work on a programming assignment, it must be **your** program, not your adaptation of someone else's program.

There may be some non-graded lab assignments (I will precisely stress that) - therefore, you may work with other students on them. However, I do expect you to complete them. You are encouraged to utilize the class time to work on the labs and ask any questions about them.

When a faculty member believes a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, the faculty member must inform the student in writing and then has ten business days from that written notification to the student to report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and the Department Chair. Documentation related to instances of academic dishonesty will be kept on file in the student’s permanent record. If the academic dishonesty is the student’s first offense, the faculty member will have the discretion to decide on a suitable sanction up to a grade of 0 for the course. Students are not permitted to withdraw from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty.

Attendance and Participation
-----------------
I expect you to attend class and participate regularly in class activities. If you miss a class, please notify me in advance. You are responsible for all material covered in class, regardless of whether or not you were present. If you attend and participate in class regularly, you can expect to receive full credit for attendance and participation.

Frequent absence and/or lack of participation will reduce the credit you receive for attendance and participation. The first absence will result in a 1 percentage point deduction from your final grade. The total percentage point deduction for 2 or greater absences will be calculated using the following formula:

> 2<sup>(<i>absences</i> - 1)</sup>

where *absences* is the number of times you were absent. Therefore, with 5 absences (2.5 weeks), you will have a 16 percentage point deduction, which will automatically drop you 1.5 to 2 letter grades.

You are responsible for keeping up with the reading assignments as described in the course schedule.

Professionalism
-----------------

I expect you to conduct yourself as a professional in this course. Professionalism includes:

-   Respect for and courteous interaction with peers, faculty and facilities;
-   Integrity, which includes at its core honesty, responsibility and accountability for one’s own actions;
-   Sensitivity and appreciation for diverse cultures, backgrounds, and life experiences;
-   Constructive evaluation, which means that criticism is offered and accepted in a productive manner;
-   Self-reflection and identification of one’s own strengths and weaknesses;
-   Responsibility for one’s own education and learning;
-   An attitude that fosters professional behavior in colleagues and peers;
-   Punctuality at meetings and class sessions;
-   Attentive behavior during class sessions, avoiding personal or social use of cell phones, laptops, or other electronic devices;
-   Acknowledgement of the Kinsley Engineering Center as a professional workplace, and treatment of this facility as a business or office space, not as an informal space.

I reserve the right to enforce this code through the York College Code of Student Conduct.

Use of Personal Technology in the Classroom
-----------------

While York College recognizes students' need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate. The college recognizes and supports faculty members' authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

Communication Standards
-----------------

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers. Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations. In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking. Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.

Auditing
-----------------

I expect some effort and commitment from students auditing the course. Therefore I require that you appear for all the labs and exams in the course. You are not required to turn in the programming assignments. Of course, you are welcome to do more, but you must meet this minimum requirement.

Disability accommodation
-----------------

If you had an IEP or 504 plan in high school or if you have a disability or health condition that impacts you in the classroom, please contact Linda Miller, Director of Disability Support Services, at 815-1785 or <lmille18@ycp.edu> to discuss obtaining the accommodations for which you may be eligible. If you already have an accommodation memo and wish to access your accommodations in this class, please see me confidentially to discuss.

Advice
-----------------

- Don't wait until the last minute to start projects! The projects can be time-consuming. Pace yourself. Students who procrastinate generally suffer.

- Ask the questions you have.

- Participate actively in discussions! Don’t use slides to answer questions during class.

Disclaimer
-----------------

The instructor reserves the right to modify all policies within this syllabus including, but not limited to, number of
assignments, weighting of assignments, and homework policies. Any significant changes will be announced to all students
via email.
